This is the procedure you will follow as a group durring group project week. Familiarize yourselves with it now:

* For release in product
  * prepare your workspace - empty repos, roles, ...
  * define the scope of our project, come up with user stories
  * decide the tools and libraries.  react? passport strategies? build tools?
  * create a 'dependency tree' of stories
  * select an order for features based on the tree  
  * decide on an architecture:  
    * mvc? apps/components? microservices? spa? ssr?  
    * choose the one that makes most sense for your product, development, and maintenance. 
    * if done well, a user shouldn't know the difference (unless it's slow or crashes)  
  * plan specs for each feature
  * __while feature in list__
    * write tests
    * test your code
    * push your code
    * assemble and test the feature
    * reflect
    * plan how this could be done better next feature
    * document - hopefully autmatically
    * coffee break
  * complete testing
  * complete demo (if appropriate)
  * complete documentation
