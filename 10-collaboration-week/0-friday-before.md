# friday before

Next week is not about writing code.  Next week is about the collaborative development process and keeping end users (developers and user-users) in mind through the entire process.  
* Don't have high hope for finished products.  
* Do commit to the group projects.
* Don't get carried away with your individual progects.

Today we form groups and choose projects
* if you have a project you an pitch it  
* if you don't have a project you can choose one to work on  
* each group will have 3-5 people

Homework:  
* Collaborative Development 
  * [Mythical Man Month wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month).  
* User-Focused Development
  * [Don't make me think](http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/9780321965516/samplepages/0321965515.pdf).

This list is currated from [here](https://blog.codinghorror.com/recommended-reading-for-developers/) chosen because they're the most learning per reading time, and directly helpful for next week.
Skim through it if you're ever looking for good developer reads that aren't directly about code.
